# nice.

In this project I have queries here from what I learned about
JOINs by combining rows from different tables.

As the name implies, lyft_trip_data, I am a Data Analyst at Lyft,
the ride-sharing platform, and I'm given three tables to work from --

- trips: trips information
- riders: user data
- cars: autonomous cars

Drive safely!
